			<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Hechinger Report is the premier news magazine covering education in America. Headquartered at the Teacher’s College of Columbia University, their mission is to cover inequality and innovation in the American educational system. That coverage highlights what is and isn’t working in the classroom. Coverage is broad, yet deep, examining topics such as common core, the cost of higher education and the rise of charter schools. <br><br>The staff believes education is one of the central issues facing society. That dedication of purpose rubbed of on our project team, as we set to help Hechinger re-imagine their website.</p>
